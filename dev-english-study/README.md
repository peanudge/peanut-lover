# Developer English Study

`2022.02.08 ~`

## Introduce

First I joined the robotics industry as fullstack software engineer.
Using C# and C# WebFramework(ASP.NET Core), I made applications for controlling robot arms.

The work itself was fun, but I had doubts about my software knowledge.

I wanted to work on O2O(offline to oline) service like 배달의 민족.

I joined to 우아한 테크캠프 4th as internship

It was like a hackton for two months. it was hard. but i met a lot of good people and learned a lot of hard skills as well as soft skills.

Unfortunately, I failed the final interview. I couldn`t answer in detail what i wanted to do.

But, I was happy, because I knew what to do next.

`I want to experience how startups grow to unicorn`

So I am currently in a startup. Company is Miso.

Miso is App Service that provide home service like home cleaning, moving service etc. it`s preparing to invest in series B.

Maybe, as company is growing,
I will be able to see and feel a lot as junior developer.

## Tech Short-term goals

- Quickly, I want to become a senior developer soon.

1. Mastering TDD.

Most people say TDD is good but don`t act directly. so im practing TDD

2. I want to try the overall service design(Frontend, Backend, if need infrastructure)

I`m ready to start learning AWS Cloud Service(EC2 or Lambda) in depth.

## Why did i get involved Dev English Study?

1. To understand tech conference on youtube

2. After two months, I have to collaborate with a foreign team joining the company.
